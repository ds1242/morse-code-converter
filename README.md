# Morse Code Converter

## What this does:
This is two quick functions that takes user input from the command line and then returns it in morse code. The output has spaces between each character to represent
the normal break between letters.  I also added slashes between word to show how it might look as a sentence and provide more obvious information to the user.

## Things to change or improve:
There has to be a better way to look through the dictionary created to store morse values.
